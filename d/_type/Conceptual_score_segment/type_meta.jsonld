(@@TODO: need to expand on - or link to - a MELD session)\r\n\r\nA conceptual score is made up from (a segment line of?) conceptual score segment entities that are instances of mo:Score and also of frbr:Expression and mo:Segment.\r\n\r\nEach conceptual score segment has a number parts (frbr:part values) described as meld:muzicode values and also as frbr:Expression values.  Depending on the application of MELD, other kinds of segment part may be described.\r\n\r\nEach muzicode segment part is related to a meld:MEIEmbodiment which is an rdf:Bag of references to elements in the score published as MEI, which itself is a frbr:Manifestation of the score expression.\r\n",
